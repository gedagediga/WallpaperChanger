# WallpaperChanger

- ## Educational Use Only

This script is designed for educational institutions where students frequently change their wallpaper. By using the [`start.bat`](https://github.com/gedagediga/WallpaperChanger/blob/main/start.bat) script, you can ensure that the wallpaper is reset to a consistent image upon startup and change.

- ## Overview

  **[`start.bat`](https://github.com/gedagediga/WallpaperChanger/blob/main/start.bat)**: This file serves as the "installer." It downloads the `.ps1` script to Temp on the system to prevent students from deleting it. Also makes a directory for the configuration. Which is used on the `.ps1` script.

  The shorter link for the [`start.bat`](https://github.com/gedagediga/WallpaperChanger/blob/main/start.bat) is `http://wallpaper301.gedagediga.lol` (Thanks [`iakzs`](https://github.com/iakzs) for the domain)
- ## Important Notice

  This program should only be used in environments where you have explicit permission to do so. The creators of this software do not accept 
  any responsibility for any consequences that may arise from its use. You are solely responsible for any damages incurred.

  Please use this script responsibly and ethically.

### TODO
- ~~Add customization for the links on start.bat 1st run.~~
- Logging system to see who tried to change the wallpaper.
- ~~Be checking for every wallpaper change instead of on startup.~~
- Allowing extensions. (For more features, and all following the [Important Notice](https://github.com/notthecoolguyyouknow/WallpaperChanger/blob/main/README.md#important-notice))
