# Educational Use Only

This script is designed for educational institutions where students frequently change their wallpaper. By modifying the variables in the [`noesunvirus.ps1`](https://github.com/notthecoolguyyouknow/WallpaperChanger/blob/main/noesunvirus.ps1) script, you can ensure that the wallpaper is reset to a consistent image upon startup.

## Overview

- **[`start.bat`](https://github.com/notthecoolguyyouknow/WallpaperChanger/blob/main/start.bat)**: This file serves as the "installer." It downloads the `.ps1` script to multiple locations on the system to prevent students from deleting it.
